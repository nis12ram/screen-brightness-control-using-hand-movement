# screen-brightness-control-using-hand-movement

-> here i have created a model using opencv and yolov8 which can chnage the screen brightness as your hand moves up & down.

-> Moving hand up will decrease the screen brightness.
-> Moving hand down will increase the screen brightness.

-> hand detection.pt have model weights trained using yolov8n on pretrained weights

-> model.py is a file where you can run the model on your specific source
